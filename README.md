# Airline Delays

In this project, I played the role of a consultant working for one of the air carriers. The task was to optimize the process of providing and analyzing data.

While working on the project, tasks are simulated in modules:

* Data Engineer - gathering and preparing data - Notebook 1 - 3
Downloading data from API, processing csv files and loading data into the database

* Data Analyst - analyzing data - Notebooks 4
Working with files and the Pandas library

* BI Developer - Building reporting scheme - Notebook 5
Creating reporting schema and views using SQL

The project was an independent work to be completed at the end of 'Data Analyst' course conducted by IT school CodersLab.
